##Description
ALX AirBnB Clone Software Engineer Project. This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration

##Description of the command interpreter:
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

##Some of the commands available are:

show
create
update
destroy
count
And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:

Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Updating attributes of an object
Destroying an object
